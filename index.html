      <p><b>My love for technology:</b></p>
      <p class="writeups">
        I love technology because it <em> changes the world</em> by making it a
        more civilised place to live. And it makes self-education easier, one
        can learn anything from anywhere. It makes people to have more chances
        to be happy and/or successful. It's ever-changing.
        <b>There's never a dull moment!</b>

      <p><b>What I have learnt so far:</b></p>
      <p class="writeups">
        I have been able to learn about the structure of a website, and its
        appearance/styling. I also learnt that there are three ways to write CSS
        in a document. And also the cascading hierarchy and various properties
        of CSS. I have also been able to learn about git as a version control
        system, and also how to use it to manage my codes.

      <p><b>The importance of CSS:</b></p>
      <p class="writeups">
        The importance of CSS cannot be <b><i>over-emphasized</i></b> because
        without it most sites we see today won't look very pleasing to the eyes.
        CSS is what beautifies the structure of a website, and it also brings
        about great user experience.

      <p><b>The difference between paddings, margins, and borders:</b></p>
      <p class="writeups">
        A content is bounded by padding which is again bounded by the border.
        The border is again bounded by the margin. <br />
        <b><i>Border</i></b> is the strip that goes around your div/element of
        the content. <b><i>Padding</i></b> is the space between the content and
        the border. <b><i>Margin</i></b> is the space outside the border of an
        element. If you need to add some space around an image or a text area,
        you can add a margin to the relevant item.<br />
